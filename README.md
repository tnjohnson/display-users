Coding Challenge

Code Test

Scenario:

A client has user data for all of their employees that they would like to visualize. They’ve asked
to be able to go through a summary of all the data in list format and also to be able to see any
single user in detail. Unfortunately, this client is very vague and is unable to give you more
information. Though they have said that they want it usable and fast.

Desired Outcome:

There should be one main page with the users data listed. The client should be able to click on
a user in the list and navigate to a details page where they can view more information.
  ● Main page
    ○ List summary - include full name, email, and city/country
  ● Details page
    ○ Include photo, full name, email, full address, phone number, and date of birth

Requirements:

  ● The application should be built in React and Node. Feel free to use any other libraries or
state management tools that you feel is best.
  ● Use the randomuser.me third party API to fetch user data in a server backend.
  ● Display the fetched user data in a react frontend. A total of 7,000 users should be
accessible in the main page list summary.
  ● Styling is not a requirement so there is no need to style beyond functionality. Beyond
that is your own preference
